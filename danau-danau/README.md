Head to the following [page](insertlinkhere) to find analysis about the game.

## To do list

* Page features
Some Ideas:
1. Create custom play button component
2. Create navbar --> Restart game, help, change soundfx, change-color ingame (?)
3. Might change water and protected with other assets to make the game more visible
* ~~Implement main menu~~ (really basic, need to add features)
* ~~Implement pop-up when someone wins, or when someone pick invalid square~~
* Wrapper for gameboard
* Choose Player Name
* Choose Player Color --> RGB (?)
* ~~Implement Undo~~
* Implement suitable board generation function that matches problem description
* Implement bot (in case no suitable board generation function, must hardcode game-file)
* Add bot to main-menu choice
